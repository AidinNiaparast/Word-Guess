# Word-Guess
Second project of the Advanced Programming course taken in Spring 2017

This project's goal is to implement a two-player game with socket programming in java.

For running the game, first, you should run Server.java in the src/project2 directory and then run Client_console.java for creating a player in the game (for several players, you should run this file several times).
